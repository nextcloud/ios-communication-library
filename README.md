# iOS communication library [beta]

## Installation

### Carthage

[Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) is a decentralized dependency manager that builds your dependencies and provides you with binary frameworks.

To integrate **Nextcloud iOS Communication** into your Xcode project using Carthage, specify it in your `Cartfile`:

```
github "nextcloud/ios-communication-library" "master"
```

Run `carthage update` to build the framework and drag the built `NCCommunication.framework` into your Xcode project.
